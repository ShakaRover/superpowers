# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch superpowers:code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the work product, not your thought process, and preserves your own context for continued work.

AUTO-CONTINUE: ON
- Default/Recommended Answer: N/A
- Recommendation Rationale: N/A
- Assumptions/Scope: Full automation by default; slow mode is an exception
- Risk Note (if any): High-risk actions will be flagged
- Completion-claim constraint: If verification fails or review does not pass, record failure only; do not claim completion (auto-continue).

Status Output Language
- Status: PASSED / NOT-PASSED / UNKNOWN (TIMEOUT/MISSING) / SKIPPED (MISSING INPUT)
- Reason: ...
- Impact: ...
- Continuation Strategy: AUTO-CONTINUE

Status Output Rules
- Late responses only append a "late response" note and never update prior status.
- Status records are written only in the assistant reply (no mandatory persistence).

## Operational Rules

- Missing input rule does not apply to review/verification steps. If required inputs are missing, follow the failure/unknown status paths and auto-continue.
- Default downgrade: for non-review inputs, prefer the most recent available output; otherwise use a default placeholder and record the source plus downstream impact. If the default is `N/A`, record "MISSING INPUT - NOT EXECUTABLE" and set status to `SKIPPED (MISSING INPUT)`.
- Timeout + retry + idempotency: on 60s timeout, perform one idempotent retry (no duplicate side effects), wait another 60s, then record status. Review/subagent timeouts -> `UNKNOWN (TIMEOUT/MISSING)`. Verification timeouts or failures -> `NOT-PASSED`. Late responses only append a note and never update prior status.
- Status linkage: missing input -> SKIPPED; timeout/missing -> UNKNOWN.
## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent:**

Use Task tool with superpowers:code-reviewer type, fill template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders:**
- `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}` - What you just built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch superpowers:code-reviewer subagent]
  WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: Verification and repair functions for conversation index
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/superpowers/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**
- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**
- Review after each batch (3 tasks)
- Get feedback, apply, continue

**Ad-Hoc Development:**
- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
